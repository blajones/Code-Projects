# Code-Projects

This repository contains projects that I've worked on the last two years. The projects are based in machine learning, visualization, and exploratory data analysis. Projects are written in python and R code.

# Project Descriptions

* Altuve_ML.py predicts whether or not Jose Altuve will get a base hit using decision tree classification.
* Altuve_Random_Forest.py predicts whether or not Jose Altuve will get a base hit using random forest classification.
* Baseball Player Similarity & More.py allows the user to type in a player name and will be provided visualizations showing the most similar players by stats. At the end it is also shown the similarities between Julio Rodriguez and other top hitters, as well as a linear regression between on-base percentage and batting average and their effect on wins. 
* Better Neural Network.py is a neural network that predicts the price of a house given certain features in Seattle, WA.
* Clustering.Rmd uses genetic data to do average, single, and complete linkage k-means clustering as well as hierarchical clustering.
* Crime_Choropleth.py is a basic choropleth map of the United States, showing crime rates by county.
* Crime_Random_Forest.py uses random forest classification to predict on if a county's crime rate is high or low. 
* Hot-Encode.py uses one-hot encoding and neural networs with housing price data to predict the price of the house.
* House Price DT.py uses housing data to predict if the price of the house is above or below the average price of a house in Seattle, WA.
* Multiple Regression.py uses housing data and multiple linear regression to predict the price of a house in Seattle, WA.
* Predict_Crime_ML.py predicts if a crime rate is high or low using decision tree classification.
* Predicting_CrimeRates_Full_Analysis.py is a complete analysis trying to predict crime rates for each county. This contains a choropleth, exploratory data analysis, and shows multiple regression models. The goal was to figure out what model was the most accurate. Principal Component Analysis was also used.
* Visualization1.Rmd are visualizations created with New York City flight data.
* Visualization2.Rmd are more visualizations createdd with New York City flight data.
* XGBoost.py uses housing data and XGBoost Classification to predict if the price of a house is above or below the average home price in Seattle, WA.
* crime vs poverty.py is a choropleth of counties and their crime rates, as well as a linear regression figure showing the correlation between poverty and county crime rates.
* pandas-profiling test.py is a report produced by the pandas package, and the data taken into account was county crime data from 2016.
